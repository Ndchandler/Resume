            <p>Developed a campaign for a medicinal wine brand that is infused with Cannabidiols (CBD) and flowers such as calendula, chamomile, lavender, and hibiscus that have healing properties. 
              Blaze and Spark is aimed to aid stress, anxiety, pain, blood pressure, and digestion. In this project I made an advertisment and a gif for my campaign using Adobe Photoshop. </p>
